**Diálogo 1** 
A: Good morning! My name's Alex. What's your name and what do you do for a living? 
B: Hi, Alex. I'm Charlene. I'm a helpdesk technician at a medium-sized company here in Madrid. 
A: Oh, interesting! What exactly does a helpdesk technician do? 
B: Well, I'm responsible for solving IT problems over the phone or by remote access. For example, if someone can't connect to the internet or their software crashes, they call me. 
A: That must be stressful sometimes! What skills do you need for that job? 
B: Yes, it can be, but I enjoy it. I'm really good at problem solving, and I'm also skilled with people – I have to stay calm and explain things clearly, even if the client is frustrated. 
A: Do you work alone or in a team? 
B: I usually work as part of a team. There are five of us on shifts, so we help each other with difficult cases. It's great because we share knowledge. 
A: Sounds like a perfect job for you! How long have you been doing it? 
B: About three years now. I started right after my IT degree.

**Diálogo 2** 
A: Hello! I'm Laura. Tell me about yourself – where are you from and what’s your job?

A: Wow, you're really busy! Why do you do both jobs? 
B: I love technology, and the extra money helps. Plus, repairing at night lets me use my skills in a more personal way.

A: Do you need special skills for that? B: Absolutely. I'm skilled at network configuration, cabling, and even some programming for custom solutions. I work with a team of engineers too. A: Impressive! How did you get into this field? B: I have a degree in computer science, and I did an internship at the company. Now I've been here for five years and love it.

### Parte 2: 3 diálogos más extensos sobre cambiar un disco duro (preguntando a un operario del servicio técnico)

**Diálogo 1** 
A: Good afternoon, this is technical support? My name's María, and I have a desktop computer at home. The hard drive is making strange noises, and I think I need to replace it. Can you guide me step by step? 
B: Hello, María. Yes, I'm Javier from support. No problem, we can do this together. First, make sure the computer is completely turned off and unplugged from the power socket. Safety first! 
A: Okay, it's off and unplugged. What now? 
B: Great. You'll need a screwdriver. Unscrew and remove the two side panels of the computer case. There are usually clips or screws on the back – just gently slide them off and set them aside. 
A: Done, both panels are off. I can see inside now. Where is the hard drive? 
B: Perfect. The hard drive is a rectangular metal box, usually in a bay near the front. Find the old one, unscrew the four screws holding it in place, and carefully disconnect the power cable and the data cable (it's a flat ribbon or SATA cable). 
A: I've removed the old drive. I have the new one ready. How do I install it? 
B: Excellent. Slide the new hard drive into the same bay and screw it securely with the four screws. Then, connect the power cable from the power supply and the data cable to the motherboard – make sure they click in firmly. 
A: All connected. Anything else inside? 
B: Double-check no loose cables. Now, put the two side panels back on and screw them tightly. Plug the power cable back into the wall, turn on the computer, and listen – it should boot up if everything is correct. 
A: It's turning on! Thank you so much, Javier. That was easier than I thought.

**Diálogo 2** A: Hi, support line? I'm Pedro from Barcelona. My desktop PC's hard drive failed completely – no data, nothing. I bought a new SSD. Can you walk me through replacing it? I'm a bit nervous. B: Hi, Pedro. This is Ana. Don't worry, it's straightforward if we go slowly. Start by shutting down the computer, unplugging it from the electricity, and also unplug any other cables like monitor or keyboard for space. A: All unplugged and off. Ready for the next step. B: Good. Use a Phillips screwdriver to unscrew the screws on both side panels – usually two or three per side at the back. Remove the panels carefully and place them on a clean surface. A: Panels removed. I see dust inside – should I clean it? B: Yes, quick tip: use compressed air if you have it, but not necessary now. Locate the hard drive bay – it's mounted with screws. Unscrew the old drive, gently pull out the SATA data cable (thin red or black) and the power cable (wider). A: Old drive out. The new SSD is smaller – does it fit the same? B: Yes, most bays have adapters or you can use the same screws. Screw the new SSD into place firmly but not too tight. Reconnect the data cable to the SSD and to a SATA port on the motherboard, then the power cable. A: Connected everything. Looks good. What’s next? B: Replace both side panels and screw them back. Plug in all cables – power, monitor, etc. Turn on the PC. If it asks to install the OS, you'll need a USB with Windows or whatever system you use. A: Booting up now – success! You're a lifesaver, Ana. Thanks!

**Diálogo 3** A: Hello, technical service? This is Sofia calling from Valencia. My office desktop has a failing hard drive, and I need to swap it for a new one today. Please guide me carefully – I have tools ready. B: Hi, Sofia. I'm Miguel. Happy to help. First things first: power off the computer fully, unplug the main power cord, and for extra safety, press the power button a few times to discharge any remaining electricity. A: Done – completely off and unplugged. Proceeding. B: Excellent. Open the case by unscrewing and sliding off the left and right side panels. There might be thumb screws or regular ones – keep the screws in a safe spot. A: Both panels off. Inside looks organized. Where exactly is the hard drive located? B: Usually in a drive cage near the bottom front. It's a 3.5-inch bay for HDDs. Unscrew the four corner screws, slide the old drive out, and disconnect two cables: the wider power cable and the thinner SATA data cable. Note which port they were in. A: Cables disconnected, old drive removed. New drive is here – same size. B: Perfect. Insert the new hard drive into the empty bay, align the screw holes, and secure it with the four screws. Plug the SATA data cable back into the drive and the same motherboard port, then the power cable – push until you hear a click. A: All screwed and connected. No errors visible. B: Now, carefully attach the side panels again and tighten all screws. Reconnect the power cord, turn on the computer, and enter the BIOS if needed (press Del or F2) to ensure the new drive is detected. Then install your operating system. A: It's detected and booting! Thank you, Miguel – that was detailed and perfect. Have a great day!
